Hello :) I'm Jacob Shkrob interested in science, music, art, and the answers to every question I've ever asked. This blog isn't really something that I'm used to doing in terms of creative writing, but then again I'm not necissarily a "creative" anyway. My posts will be dedicated to the unseen and unobvious, the inextricably strange and confusing, to the primordial and experimental. Mostly it will contain ramblings personally related to things I find interesting and seldom discussed among most people (at least, I hope); I'm mostly taking the format of this blog after reading the many amazing posts of my dad's blog, where he would answer questions that I asked as a child, and discuss with his fellow bloggers possible solutions to whatever he was thinking about. In a way, he was and still is a "digital" Socrates, walking baren through the net, on thin lines of electrical wire, philosophising the users he encounters.
So here is my blog.
Not really sure what to call it yet, but **a name is in the works**
